// There are 3 baskets labeled ‘Apples’, ‘Oranges’ & ‘Mixture’. One of them contains only Apples, one only Oranges and  one has mix of apples and oranges both.
// These baskets are not labeled correctly. In fact, the labels on these baskets always lie. (i.e. if the label says Oranges, Then you are sure the basket either has only Apples or Mixture).
// You are allowed to pick one fruit from one basket (Not allowed to see other fruits), and you have to put all the labels correctly on the basis of that information (by seeing only one fruit from any one basket).
// How will you do that ?
